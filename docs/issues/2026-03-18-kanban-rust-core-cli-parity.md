# Kanban board/card operations are not first-class in Rust core RPC, which blocks CLI parity and duplicates workflow semantics

## What Happened

Routa already has a meaningful Kanban domain model in Rust (`KanbanBoard`, `KanbanColumn`, task `board_id` / `column_id` / `position`) and a much richer Kanban workflow surface in the web stack. However, the Rust JSON-RPC layer still exposes only agents, tasks, notes, workspaces, and skills.

As a result:

- the CLI cannot manage boards and cards as first-class concepts through the same `routa-core` RPC interface it uses for other entities;
- Kanban behavior is split across multiple implementations:
  - Rust core data/store model
  - Rust server HTTP/MCP handlers
  - TypeScript Kanban tools and route handlers
- board/card semantics such as default-board resolution, column validation, task-status mapping, and card shaping are repeated instead of being defined once in a shared core contract.

## Why This Matters

This creates an architectural mismatch with the stated CLI design that the CLI should be a thin adapter over `routa-core`.

The current shape raises several risks:

- CLI users cannot work with Kanban in the same way they work with tasks/workspaces.
- Rust server routes and MCP handlers continue to own business logic that should belong to shared core services or RPC methods.
- Future Kanban changes are more likely to drift between Rust and TypeScript implementations.
- The control-plane direction of Kanban becomes harder to stabilize because the shared backend contract is incomplete.

## Expected Behavior

- Rust core should expose first-class `kanban.*` RPC methods for board and card operations.
- CLI should consume those RPC methods through thin command adapters.
- Shared board/card semantics should live in Rust core rather than being duplicated in server-specific handlers.

## Notes

This issue is about shared backend contract and CLI parity, not full Kanban automation. Story-level workflow execution, lane/session lifecycle, and automation reliability remain broader follow-up concerns.
